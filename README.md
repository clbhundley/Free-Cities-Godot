# Free-Cities-Godot
A reboot of Free Cities created in Godot.

## About
The goal of this project is to recreate Free Cities in the Godot engine with complete visuals, audio, a redesigned GUI, and enhanced gameplay features.
Using Godot will completely eliminate performance issues and provide a much more user-friendly environment to work on the game. It also has built-in debugging, and no need to compile to test changes.
